# Click Wheel designer

When I tried to create the clickwheel the first time, it was hard and today I just miraculously wrote a super simple code that works. Here is the tool I used, if someone out there needs it.

<Clickwheel />

### How to use 

 - Use the UI above to choose your pattern
 - Click on the "Download PNG" button to download the PNG file 
 - In Kicad, use the image converter, and copy the shape to clipboard
 - Paste the shape in your PCB Editor ( press E to change the layer to cut/copper)
