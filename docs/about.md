# About Openpod

Openpod is an ESP32 mp3 player. It uses: 
 - MCU: ESP32
 - Codec: VS1063
 - Display: ST7735
 - SD Card: SPI
 - Click wheel: MPR121
 - Battery: LiPo
 - Interface: USB-C
 - Power: 5V


### Why?  
Long story short: I don't have a smartphone, I loooove podcasts, and I am nostalgic of my old Ipod, tragically stolen from me. I'd rather build something myself then buying something I don't like.
